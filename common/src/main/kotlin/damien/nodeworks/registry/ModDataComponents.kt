/**
 * Registry object for Nodeworks' custom [DataComponentType]s.
 *
 * Data components are Nodeworks-managed NBT-like state attached to an item instance.
 * Using a typed component (vs. dumping everything into `CUSTOM_DATA`) gives us:
 *   * Structured codec + stream-codec per field, so persistence and client sync are
 *     defined once and can't silently drift out of alignment.
 *   * Per-field equality for stack stacking/merging rules, two Portables with the
 *     same installed crystal stack (by value) stack, with different crystals they
 *     don't.
 *   * Vanilla tooling (creative tab filters, /give arg parsing, recipe ingredient
 *     matching) integrates for free.
 *
 * Registration happens during the block-registry RegisterEvent window in
 * `Nodeworks.onRegister`, NeoForge allows cross-registry writes during any
 * RegisterEvent, so we chain this after block registration and before item
 * registration without introducing a new event listener.

     * empty, accessors treat both cases identically so callers never need to
