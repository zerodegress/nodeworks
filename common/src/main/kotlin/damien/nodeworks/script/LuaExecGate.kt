/**
 * Wall-clock execution gate around Lua entry points. Mirrors CC: Tweaked's
 * safety model: a soft-abort throws a [TimeoutLuaError] from the bytecode hook
 * when a deadline is exceeded, propagating up through the standard error path.
 * No hard abort. The per-tick budget at [NeoForgeTerminalPackets.tickAll] is
 * the layered backstop for scripts that catch the soft-abort via `pcall` and
 * keep looping.
 *
 * Each Lua entry point (top-level chunk, scheduler tick callback,
 * redstone/observer onChange) runs with its own budget: enter the gate, set a
 * deadline relative to `nanoTime()`, run the body, clear the deadline on exit.
 * Idle scripts that just registered handlers consume no budget time because no
 * Lua bytecode is running.
 *
 * Mechanism: install a custom [DebugLib] subclass at [Globals.debuglib]
 * (bypassing the normal `g.load(DebugLib())` path so the `debug` global table
 * is not exposed to scripts). The bytecode interpreter calls
 * `globals.debuglib.onInstruction(...)` for every Lua bytecode; our subclass
 * increments a counter and checks the wall-clock deadline once every
 * [ServerSafetySettings.instructionsPerWallClockCheck] instructions. On
 * overrun the hook throws, the caller catches and routes to the appropriate
 * cleanup (autoRun-disable for top-level, eviction for callbacks).
 *
 * The hook only fires while a deadline is active (`deadlineNs > 0`), so calls
 * into Lua that happen outside a gated entry don't trip a stale deadline.
