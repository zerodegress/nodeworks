/**
 * Standard string subtypes used across the Lua API. Each declares a typed string
 * domain, the autocomplete dispatcher and diagnostics analyzer route every
 * `param("...", X)` reference through these instead of opaque [LuaType.Primitive.String]
 * so context-aware completion and "did you mean..." warnings come for free.
 *
 * Dynamic domains ([LuaType.StringDomain]) are tied to runtime sources via
 * [LuaCompletionSources]. The actual source bodies are registered later by the
 * autocomplete and runtime initialisation code, the type declaration here is just
 * the contract.
 *
 * Adding a new domain: declare it here, register a source in [LuaCompletionSources]
 * that returns the live values, then use it as a method parameter type in any
 * [api] spec. Autocomplete + diagnostics light up automatically.
