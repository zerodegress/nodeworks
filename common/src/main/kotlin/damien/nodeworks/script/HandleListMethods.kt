/**
 * Registry of broadcast-safe method names per scriptable handle type.
 *
 * `HandleList<T>` (returned by `network:getAll(type)` / `Channel:getAll(type)`)
 * exposes a fan-out version of every method listed here for the relevant T,
 * calling `:set(true)` on a `HandleList<RedstoneCard>` invokes `:set(true)` on
 * each member. Only "write" methods belong here: ones whose call site doesn't
 * depend on the return value, so discarding return values across N members
 * still does what the user wanted.
 *
 * **REQUIRED: any new card or device type added to the scripting API must
 * update this registry.** If you add Breaker/Placer/PlayerSensor/etc.:
 *
 *   1. Add a new entry to [byCapabilityType] (cards) or [byHandleType] (variables
 *      and other non-card handles).
 *   2. List every method that should fan out across HandleList members.
 *   3. Anything not listed is silently absent from `HandleList<T>`, only
 *      `:list()` and `:count()` are universal.
 *
 * Read methods (powered, strength, block, state, get, find, count, length…)
 * are deliberately NOT broadcast: their return value is the whole point of
 * calling them, and silently dropping return values across N members is a
 * footgun. Reads always go through `:list()` + per-member access.
 *
 * The runtime read of this registry happens in
 * `ScriptEngine.createHandleListTable`. Do not bypass it, letting one site
 * inline its own list of broadcast methods recreates the drift this registry
 * exists to prevent.
