/**
 * Pure helper for round-robin work spreading. Used by [NetworkInventoryCache] to
 * split a per-poll-cycle scan of every Storage Card across multiple ticks instead
 * of doing the whole burst on one tick.
 *
 * Given a list of items, a cycle index, and a slice count, returns the slice of
 * items that should be visited on this tick. Successive cycle indices walk
 * through the list in chunks of `ceil(items.size / sliceCount)`. After
 * `sliceCount` cycles, every item has been visited exactly once and the cycle
 * wraps back to the beginning.
 *
 * Kept as its own object (not an extension function on List) so the algorithm is
 * easy to unit-test in isolation, no Minecraft world required.

     *   pass an unbounded counter and get the right wrap-around.
