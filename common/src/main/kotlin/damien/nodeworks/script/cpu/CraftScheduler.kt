/**
 * Per-CPU craft driver. Holds at most one active [CraftPlan] plus a backlog of
 * submitted-but-not-yet-running plans, and executes ready ops every server tick.
 *
 * **Threading model (Phase 3, Option A, shared ready queue):**
 * The scheduler does NOT assign ops to named threads. Instead, [threadCount]
 * acts as a parallelism budget: per tick we start up to [threadCount] ready ops,
 * minus any currently-[inProgress] async ops (which still hold a slot). Any
 * available execution slot can pick up any ready op, co-processors don't
 * "own" branches. This is strictly more parallelism-friendly than per-thread
 * plan assignment, and keeps the state machine centralized here.
 *
 * [threadCount] is updated externally whenever the CPU's multiblock is
 * recalculated ([damien.nodeworks.block.entity.CraftingCoreBlockEntity.recalculateCapacity]).
 * Growing is immediate, shrinking takes effect on the next tick, in-flight async
 * ops always finish, so removing a Co-Processor mid-craft never strands state.
 *
 * All scheduler state lives on the server thread (driven by [BlockEntityTicker]).
 * No locks needed: the CPU BE is only ticked by the server's main thread.
